S60: Containers CI/CD pipeline creation
1. Containers is Linux Feature
2. It works only in Linux OS
3.Control groups and namespaces features - containers runs based on this feature and security comes from this features
4.Control Groups - Containers capable of consuming all resources of OS,Yet we need to control the utilization and its been done by control groups - limit the resources,manage the usage of resources
5. Namespaces - meant to isolate the resources , ex netns  is network namespaces for containers
6. Docker - why docker
    1.Simple EcoSystem -  whole ecosystem is simple and docker image part is simple to setup
    2. Best UX - User eXperience - Simpler to Manage and extends its features to interact over APIs
7.Docker brings immutability - Never modify the existing container
8.Any container runtimes will have two types
    1.High Level Runtime -
    2.Low Level Runtime
9. Docker architecture :
    Docker Client
    Docker Host (Docker daemon)
    ContainerD
10.Docker Image - An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.
    to run any docker container it needs an docker image
11.Installation - 2 types
    Docker runs by default by root user -
    if we give permission to normal user then its gain most of the privileges as root user
    it causes security issues - to avoid this ROOTLESS installation is preferable
    where normal user can run containers even with out root privilege
